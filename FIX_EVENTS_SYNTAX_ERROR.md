# Fix: Events Page Syntax Error - RESOLVED ✅

## Error Description
**Date**: October 21, 2025, 14:47:06 UTC
**Error Type**: ParseError
**Message**: `syntax error, unexpected token "else", expecting end of file`
**File**: `resources/views/front/events.blade.php:111`
**Status Code**: 500

## Root Cause
The file had **duplicate Blade code** between lines 109-195, causing a syntax error:

```blade
@endif
@else        // <- DUPLICATE/ORPHAN @else causing error
    <div class="text-center py-5">
        ...
    </div>
@endif
```

The duplication included:
- Duplicate `@endif @else` blocks
- Duplicate event card rendering code
- Duplicate pagination sections
- Orphaned closing tags

## Solution Applied

### Fixed the Structure:
Removed all duplicate code and ensured proper Blade syntax:

```blade
<!-- Correct Structure -->
@if(isset($events) && $events->count() > 0)
    <div class="row g-4">
        @foreach($events as $event)
            <!-- Event card HTML -->
        @endforeach
    </div>
    
    <!-- Pagination -->
    @if($events->hasPages())
        {{ $events->links() }}
    @endif
@else
    <!-- No events message -->
@endif
```

### What Was Removed:
- Lines 110-111: Duplicate `@endif @else`
- Lines 122-195: Entire duplicated event rendering section
- Orphaned closing tags and malformed Blade directives

## Verification

### Test Result:
✅ **Page loads successfully**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/evenements
# Returns: 200 OK with "Community Events" title
```

### Current State:
- Events page displays correctly
- Both events visible: "Community Recycling Workshop" and "jardinage"
- Real-time AJAX search working
- Status filter working
- No syntax errors

## Files Modified:
1. `resources/views/front/events.blade.php` - Fixed duplicate code

## Testing Checklist:
- [x] Page loads without errors
- [x] Events display correctly
- [x] Search functionality works
- [x] Status filter works
- [x] AJAX real-time updates work
- [x] Images display properly
- [x] CTA section visible
- [x] No console errors

## Prevention:
This error was likely caused by a merge conflict or copy-paste duplication during the AJAX implementation. Always:
- Check for duplicate `@if/@else/@endif` blocks
- Validate Blade syntax after large changes
- Use version control to review diffs
- Test immediately after modifications

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The events page is now fully functional with real-time search!
